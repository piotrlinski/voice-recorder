Architecture Philosophy
-----------------------

The Voice Recorder follows Clean Architecture principles:

**Separation of Concerns**
    Clear boundaries between business logic, external services, and user interfaces.

**Dependency Inversion**
    All dependencies flow inward toward the domain layer, making the system
    testable and maintainable.

**Interface Segregation**
    Small, focused interfaces that define clear contracts between components.

**Single Responsibility**
    Each class and module has a single, well-defined purpose.

This architecture makes the system:

* **Testable**: Easy to unit test individual components
* **Maintainable**: Clear structure makes changes predictable
* **Extensible**: New features can be added without affecting existing code
* **Portable**: Core logic is independent of external dependencies
